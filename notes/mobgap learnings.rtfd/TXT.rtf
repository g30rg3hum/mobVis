\f1\b THIS IS THE STRUCTURE NEEDED FOR UPLOADED CSV DATA!
\f0\b0 \
\
Time is specified in seconds but time points represented as samples since start of measurement.\
\
raw imu data, accessleration is m/s^2\
angular velocity (gyr) deg/s\
magnetic field in uT \
\
data doesn\'92t need ot contain all three sensor types, but limited lagos applied to it.\
assume that data represents equally spaced samples with a fixed sampling rate.\
\
walking bouts - min  no of strides, allowed break betwene two strides.\
\
dataset that has only one row (one recording) is referred ot as a datapoint and is the expected input for all the pipelines.\
\

\cf0 can use GaitDatasetFromData to create a compatible dataset from your data, but encouraged to create a custom dataset for own data. SImplifies things and nice abstraction.\
\
data module - has helper for creating custom datasets.\
\
\
Sensor frame\
axes x, y and z should follow the directions of the MM+ sensor of the McRoberts when worn correctly.\
x axis upwards, y pointing to right, and z axis pointing forward.\
To use mobgap, need to make sure data follows the same conventions.\
\
Might need rotation matrix that transforms your data into expected coordinate system.\
Transformation usually derived based on known mounting orientation of your sensor.\
https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/prepare_data.html#converting-into-the-correct-units (do this after know the basics of how to upload csv into dataset and use into pipelines)\'85 then we can think about getting the IMU data into the correct form.\
\
If don\'92t know mounting orientation of snesor, need to estimate based on sensor data -> too complex so assume that we need to know the mounting orientation.\
\
data in sensor frame _x, _y_z so imu pandas dataframe has axes 
\f2\fs21 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
["acc_x",\'a0"acc_y",\'a0"acc_z",\'a0"gyr_x",\'a0"gyr_y",\'a0"gyr_z\'94\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs24 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Sensor frame is used when perform ing rotations or cannot assume that the orientation of the sensor is properly aligned with the body frame.\
WHenever possible work in body frame to avoid confusion about which axis points in which direction\
\
\'97\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf0 Body frame\
\
defined by IS, PA and ML, renaming of the sensor frame axis.\
x -> IS, y -> ML, z -> PA\
\
Can use the to_body_frame function, returning a dataframe with ranmed axis and the same index as the input data. 
\f1\b will only work if data is already correctly aligned with the sensor farme.\
Need to have transformed your data into expected sensor farme.\
\
Most algos expect data to be in body frame, to easily work on upwards or forward axis. \
\

\
\
TODO: transform acceleration from g to m/s^2\
\
\

\f0\b0 algorithsm currently imeplemented only require 
\f1\b sensor height in m and the cohort the participant belongs to
\f0\b0 .\
only need these two. (this counts as participant metadata)\

these are all just dictionaries\
\
 the transformation of the columns into the correct order and units is as could-do so can easily implement it later on if wanted to.\
need the correct structure as at the top screenshot\
